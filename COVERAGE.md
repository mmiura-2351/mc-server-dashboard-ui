## Generated Reports

The coverage system generates multiple report formats:

- **HTML Report**: `coverage/index.html` - Interactive, detailed view
- **Terminal Summary**: Displayed after each test run
- **LCOV Report**: `coverage/lcov.info` - Standard format for CI/CD
- **JSON Data**: `coverage/coverage-final.json` - Programmatic access

## Commands Quick Reference

```bash
# Basic coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Coverage with watch mode
npm run test:coverage:watch

# Detailed verbose report
npm run coverage:report

# Open HTML report in browser
npm run coverage:open
```

## Configuration

Coverage is configured in `vitest.config.ts` with these settings:

- **Provider**: v8 (high performance)
- **Thresholds**: Lines 80%, Functions 80%, Branches 75%, Statements 80%
- **Exclusions**: Test files, type definitions, Next.js boilerplate
- **Output**: Multiple formats for different use cases

## Next Steps

To reach 85%+ coverage across all metrics:

1. **Expand API Service Tests**: Add comprehensive API client testing
2. **File Service Edge Cases**: Test error conditions and edge cases
3. **i18n Integration**: Add locale switching and message loading tests
4. **Component Integration**: Add more integration tests for complex components
