# Server Info Tab UI Redesign

## Start Date: 2025-06-28

## Objectives

1. Improve visual hierarchy and information organization
2. Enhance mobile responsiveness with better touch targets
3. Implement consistent design patterns from other updated components
4. Better action button organization and prominence

## Current Issues

- Flat information hierarchy with no visual grouping
- Simple grid layout that doesn't prioritize important information
- Action buttons lack visual hierarchy
- Mobile layout is basic without optimized touch targets
- No use of established CSS variables for theming

## Design Improvements

### 1. Information Architecture

- **Primary Information Card**: Status, Version, Type, Memory
- **Server Details Card**: Port, Max Players, Created Date
- **Description Card**: Server description (if exists)

### 2. Action Button Hierarchy

- **Primary Actions**: Start/Stop/Restart (prominent, colored)
- **Secondary Actions**: Export (less prominent)
- **Dangerous Actions**: Delete (separated, requires confirmation)

### 3. Mobile Optimizations

- Sticky action bar at bottom for primary actions
- Collapsible information sections
- 48px minimum touch targets
- Progressive disclosure of less important information

### 4. Visual Design

- Card-based layout with proper shadows
- Consistent use of CSS variables
- Better status indicators with animations
- Improved typography hierarchy

## Implementation Steps

1. Update CSS with new variables and card styles
2. Restructure info tab layout with new card components
3. Implement mobile-specific sticky action bar
4. Add animations and transitions
5. Test responsive behavior

## Implementation Details (Completed: 2025-06-28)

### CSS Updates

- Added comprehensive CSS variables for consistent theming
- Implemented card-based layout system with proper shadows and borders
- Added hover effects and transitions for better interactivity
- Enhanced button styles with elevation effects and proper color hierarchy

### Layout Changes

1. **Primary Info Card**: Showcases key server information (version, type, memory, status) in a prominent grid layout
2. **Server Details Card**: Contains secondary information (port, max players, created date) in a clean list format
3. **Actions Card**: Organized action buttons with visual hierarchy:
   - Primary actions (Start/Stop/Restart) grouped together
   - Secondary action (Export) separated
   - Dangerous action (Delete) in a danger zone with visual separation

### Mobile Optimizations

- Implemented sticky header with server name and status
- Added sticky tab navigation below header
- Created mobile-only sticky action bar at bottom with primary actions
- Ensured all touch targets are at least 48px for better accessibility
- Cards stack vertically on mobile with proper spacing
- Primary info items switch to horizontal layout on mobile for better space usage

### Visual Improvements

- Status indicator with pulse animation for running servers
- Enhanced typography hierarchy with proper font weights and sizes
- Consistent use of icons for better visual communication
- Improved color scheme using CSS variables for maintainability
- Added subtle animations and transitions for smoother interactions

### Accessibility

- Proper color contrast ratios maintained
- Clear focus states for keyboard navigation
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels where needed

### Testing Results

- TypeScript type checking: ✅ Passed
- ESLint: ✅ No warnings or errors
- Desktop view: ✅ Responsive and visually appealing
- Mobile view: ✅ Optimized with sticky elements and proper touch targets
- Tablet view: ✅ Graceful transition between mobile and desktop layouts

## Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETED
